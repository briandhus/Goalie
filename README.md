# Motivate

## Overview
Our app allows users to achieve their goals in a timely manner by providing them with tools to break goals down into manageable tasks. We also added an element of playfulness by gamifying the process of achieving oneâ€™s goals. Users can create avatars to base their progress on by adding gear such as a sword and armor. 

## Inspiration
In an age where immediate gratification is expected in every aspect of our lives, we are in dire need of an efficient and playful mechanism to keep us on track to achieve the goals we have in life. Our motivation for creating this app was to provide users with the mechanism to plan incremental steps and track their progress on their goals. Goal setting and executing has never been easier. Join our movement today.

## Dashboard
The Dashboard displays the user's avatar image, main goal, and subtasks to accomplish that goal. The information rendered is being pulled from the database (mongoDB). As each task is completed, the user's avatar levels up and is given new gear. Once all tasks are completed, the user sees the success component on the website and is directed to create a new goal.
